A simple 'Movie Library' app with Play 2.0 framework
====================================================  

The project allows to manage a collection of movies. Users can easily find a particular film by name or by other search criteria, like genre, director, country etc. The main page shows a searching filter and a list of films. Each film is presented in the form of short description with a thumbnail of the film poster.
